![mltype](https://github.com/jankrepl/mltype/workflows/mltype/badge.svg)

Command line tool for improving typing speed and accuracy. The main goal is
to help programmers practise programming languages.

# Main features
### Text generation

- Using neural networks to generate text. One can use
  pretrained networks (see below) or train new ones from scratch.
- Alternatively, one can read text from a file or provide it manually

### Typing interface
- Dead simple (implemented in `curses`)
- Basic statistics - WPM and accuracy
- Setting target speed
- Playing against past performances

# Documentation and usage
For a detailed documentation see https://mltype.readthedocs.io. 

The entrypoint is `mlt`

```bash
$ mlt
Usage: mlt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  sample  Sample text from a language
  train   Train a language
```

# Pretrained models
See below a list of pretrained models. They are stored on a google drive
and one needs to download the entire archive.

Once you download the file, you will need to place it in `~/.mltype/languages`.
Note that if the folder does not exist you will have to create it. The file name
can be changed to whatevery you like. This name will then be used to
refer to the model.

To verify that the model was downloaded succesfully, try to sample from it.
Note that this might take 20+ seconds the first time around.

```bash
mlt sample my_new_model
```
